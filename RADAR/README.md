We are investigating what the best way it so integrate the data feeds. Options are using the OAI-PMH feed, or using the RADAR REST API. Here is [a notebook](RADAR4Culture.ipynb) looking at the raw data.

## Is it possible to specify a CGIF in the page metadata?

The RADAR team is busy adding [schema.org annotations to datasets](https://validator.schema.org/#url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radar-service.eu%2Fradar%2Fde%2Fdataset%2FSsmYZMWOuUVxrVsx)
It might be simpler to just add CGIF versions, with very little extra effort? https://www.radar-service.eu/radar/de/dataset/SsmYZMWOuUVxrVsx
