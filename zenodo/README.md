# Datasets deposited in Zenodo

This section is prompted by our colleagues in the [MatWerk](https://nfdi-matwerk.de/) consortium.

How can we use datasets like [this](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=4039531) or [this](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=4064861) in a CGIF format?

While this question is focussed on a different subject are, it will also be relevant once cultural data is deposited in Zenodo.

## Discussion

As a start, what is the best structured way to get metadata out in NFDICore compliant way? Looks like the JSON-LD is a good candidate.
You can click on the link in the page, and copy-paste the snippet, but is it also available as a content-negotaied link?

Once you have the JSON-LD, it can be converted to a more readable Turtle.

Apart from the metadata on authors/affiliation, how can we then describe the data? Which parts of the Matwerk ontology becomes relevant?
To what extent can the description of the data be automated/converted?
